    <h1>Human Organs</h1>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-right">
      <p>Your body is an amazing system! The human body is made up of groups of organs, called organ systems, that work together to keep the body in balance. </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Vital Organs</h2>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-left">
    <p>The human body contains five organs that are considered vital for survival. They are the heart, brain, kidneys, liver, and lungs. The locations of these five organs and several other internal organs are shown in the figure below. If any of the five vital organs stops functioning, the death of the organism is imminent without medical intervention.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-right">
      <p>1.	The heart is located in the center of the chest, and its function is to keep blood flowing through the body. Blood carries substances to cells that they need and also carries away wastes from cells.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-left">
      <p>2.	The brain is located in the head and functions as the body’s control center. It is the seat of all thoughts, memories, perceptions, and feelings. The two kidneys are located in the back of the abdomen on either side of the body. Their function is to filter blood and form urine, hich is excreted from the body.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-right">
      <p>3.	The liver is located on the right side of the abdomen. It has many functions, including filtering blood, secreting bile that is needed for digestion, and producing proteins necessary for blood clotting.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-left">
      <p>4.	The two lungs are located on either side of the upper chest. Their main function is exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide with the blood</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Human Organ Systems</h2>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-right">
      <p>Functionally related organs cooperate to form whole organ systems. </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Circulatory System</h2>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-left">
      <p>
        The circulatory system is the body's transport system. It is made up of a group of organs that transport blood throughout the body.<br/>
         The heart pumps the blood and the arteries and veins transport it. Oxygen-rich blood leaves the left side of the heart and enters the biggest artery, called the aorta.<br/>
         The aorta branches into smaller arteries which then branch into even smaller vessels that travel all over the body. When blood enters the smallest blood vessels, which are called capillaries, and are found in body tissue, it gives nutrients and oxygen to the cells and takes in carbon dioxide, water, and waste. The blood, which no longer contains oxygen and nutrients, then goes back to the heart through veins.<br/>
         Veins carry waste products away from cells and bring blood back to the heart, which pumps it to the lungs to pick up oxygen and eliminate waste carbon dioxide.<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Digestive System</h2>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-right">
      <p>The digestive system is made up of organs that break down food into protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, and fats, which the body needs for energy, growth, and repair.<br/>
       After food is chewed and swallowed, it goes down the esophagus and enters the stomach, where it is further broken down by powerful stomach acids.<br/>
       From the stomach the food travels into the small intestine. This is where your food is broken down into nutrients that can enter the bloodstream through tiny hair-like projections.<br/>
       The excess food that the body doesn't need or can't digest is turned into waste and is eliminated from the body.<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Endocrine System</h2>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-left">
      <p>
        The endocrine system is made up of a group of glands that produce the body's long-distance messengers,<br/>
         or hormones. Hormones are chemicals that control body functions, such as metabolism, growth, and sexual development.<br/>
         The glands, which include the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands,<br/>
        thymus gland, pineal body, pancreas, ovaries, and testes, release hormones directly into the bloodstream, which transports the hormones to organs and tissues throughout the body.<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Immune System</h2>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-left">
      <p>The immune system is our body's defense system against infections and diseases.<br/>
        Organs, tissues, cells, and cell products work together to respond to dangerous organisms (like viruses or bacteria) and substances that may enter the body from the environment.<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Lymphatic System</h2>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-right">
      <p>The lymphatic system is also a defense system for the body.<br/>
        It filters out organisms that cause disease, produces white blood cells, and generates disease-fighting antibodies.<br/>
        It also distributes fluids and nutrients in the body and drains excess fluids and protein so that tissues do not swell.<br/>
        The lymphatic system is made up of a network of vessels that help circulate body fluids.<br/>
        These vessels carry excess fluid away from the spaces between tissues and organs and return it to the bloodstream.<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Muscular System</h2>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-left">
      <p>The muscular system is made up of tissues that work with the skeletal system to control movement of the body.<br/>
        Some muscles—like the ones in your arms and legs—are voluntary, meaning that you decide when to move them. Other<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-right">
      <p>muscles, like the ones in your stomach, heart, intestines and other organs, are involuntary.<br/>
        This means that they are controlled automatically by the nervous system and hormones—you often don't even realize they're at work.<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-left">
      <p>
        The body is made up of three types of muscle tissue: skeletal, smooth and cardiac.<br/>
        Each of these has the ability to contract and expand, which allows the body to move and function. .<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-right">
      <p>•	Skeletal muscles help the body move.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-left">
      <p>•	Smooth muscles, which are involuntary, are located inside organs, such as the stomach and intestines.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-right">
      <p>•	Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart. Its motion is involuntary</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Nervous System</h2>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-left">
      <p>The nervous system is made up of the brain, the spinal cord, and nerves.<br/>
        One of the most important systems in your body, the nervous system is your body's control system. It sends, receives, and processes nerve impulses throughout the body.<br/>
        These nerve impulses tell your muscles and organs what to do and how to respond to the environment.<br/>
        There are three parts of your nervous system that work together: the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, and the autonomic nervous system.<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-right">
      <p>•	The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord.<br/>
        It sends out nerve impulses and analyzes information from the sense organs, which tell your brain about things you see, hear, smell, taste and feel.<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-left">
      <p>•	The peripheral nervous system includes the craniospinal nerves that branch off from the brain and the spinal cord.<br/>
        It carries the nerve impulses from the central nervous system to the muscles and glands.<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-right">
      <p>•	The autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary action, such as heart beat and digestion.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Respiratory System</h2>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-left">
      <p>The respiratory system brings air into the body and removes carbon dioxide.<br/>
        It includes the nose, trachea, and lungs. When you breathe in, air enters your nose or mouth and goes down a long tube called the trachea.<br/>
        The trachea branches into two bronchial tubes, or primary bronchi, which go to the lungs. The primary bronchi branch off into even smaller bronchial tubes, or bronchioles.<br/>
        The bronchioles end in the alveoli, or air sacs. Oxygen follows this path and passes through the walls of the air sacs and blood vessels and enters the blood stream.<br/>
        At the same time, carbon dioxide passes into the lungs and is exhaled.<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Skeletal System</h2>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-right">
      <p>The skeletal system is made up of bones, ligaments and tendons. It shapes the body and protects organs. The skeletal system works with the muscular system to help the body move.<br/>
        Marrow, which is soft, fatty tissue that produces red blood cells, many white blood cells, and other immune system cells, is found inside bones.<br/>
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Urinary System</h2>
    <div data-aos="fade-up-left">
      <p>The urinary system eliminates waste from the body, in the form of urine. The kidneys remove waste from the blood. The waste combines with water to form urine.<br/>
        From the kidneys, urine travels down two thin tubes called ureters to the bladder. When the bladder is full, urine is discharged through the urethra.<br/>
